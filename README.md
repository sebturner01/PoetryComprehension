# PoetryComprehension

## Overview
Given a poem this program will allow the user return quantitative information regarding the rhyming scheme,
alliteration, simile, word count, and other easily quantifiable attributes of that poem.

In addition to these attributes other more nebulous factors such as a paragraph summary of the poem (if possible) and a a vector map the semantic properties of the poem are available.

* Find similes  
* Identify Rhyme (separate dictionary or schema?)


### Semantic 
* [word2vec](http://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/6.pdf) representation of poem

* Statistics.py - #s regarding the poems
* Dataset.csv - Poem data scraped from the poetry foundation from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/johnhallman/complete-poetryfoundationorg-dataset)
